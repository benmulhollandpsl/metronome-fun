# metronome-fun
originally a metronome project
adding an interactive gif and login page using mongo db

future plans for this are a drone page, a users only area for drones, and js related music apps

## about: 
I started this in early 2009 while teaching beginning band and orchestra in Philadelphia to 1st-6th graders.  When I was 10 my beginning band had a special song called "Ghost Song" that inspired this journey.  Along the way I found some traditional songs inspired by the fantastic.  I'll include these songs in the gnome song section of this page as I edit and publish them.  My goal for this page is as a useful tool and resourse for the music teacher and student alike.  Hence, the inclusion of a Metrognome and Gnomedrones.  If I learn how to make a Gnometuner I'll be sure to include that in the future too.
